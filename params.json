Automatically resolves relative reference paths.\r\n* @embed -> embeds png,svg,js,txt into a png library file. Also generates atlas inside the png and creates a library.d.ts file\r\n\r\n##SourceFolder example:\r\n```\r\n///@source /src\r\n///@source /def\r\n```\r\n\r\n##Import example:\r\n```\r\n///@import es.xperiments.Demo\r\n```\r\nWill resolve to:\r\n```\r\n///<reference path='src/es/xperiments/demo.ts'/>\r\n```","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
