Automatically resolves relative reference paths.\r\n* @define -> use cls.ass.packages as definition imports. Automatically resolves relative reference paths to .d.ts files.\r\n\r\nPlugins developing:\r\n* @embed -> embeds png,svg,js,txt into a png library file. Also generates atlas inside the png and creates a library.d.ts file\r\n\r\n##@source example:\r\n```\r\n///@source /src\r\n///@source /def\r\n```\r\n\r\n##@import & @define example:\r\n```\r\n///@import es.xperiments.Demo\r\n///@define es.xperiments.Demo\r\n```\r\nWill resolve to:\r\n```\r\n///<reference path='src/es/xperiments/demo.ts'/>\r\n///<reference path='src/es/xperiments/demo.d.ts'/>\r\n```\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
